Labyrinth of Mythhaven
We created a game where the user has woken up in a strange place and must 
escape by fighting monsters. The user fights the monsters by tapping the screen 
to attack, pushing the shield button to block (reducing the damage dealt by the monster),
and swiping left or right to move the player to the left, middle, 
or right side of the screen. The user gains attack, defense, and health as more 
monsters are defeated. After defeating a monster, the user will be prompted with an 
option to traverse down the left or the right path. After doing this and beating 
monsters along the way for a pseudo random number of times, you win.

Our app is restricted to portrait mode.

Our game does not need any third party libraries to run. 

Currently we fight the same monster everytime. We did not have
time to design and create other monsters. We also don't persistently save the player's 
stats so if they restart the app, the stats are lost. Other than 
that, we would have spent more time making the UI look nicer.
